 PIs (Application Programming Interfaces) help this type of communication between systems by providing an interface for them to talk to each other. REST is simply a widely adopted style of API that we use to communicate with internal and external parties in a consistent and predictable way. It can be compared with how we used to send a letter with a postage stamp, address, and envelope in a certain way to ensure it gets delivered and read.
